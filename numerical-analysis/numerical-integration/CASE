[pi]
Calculate the area under the curve of 4/(x^2 + 1) in [0, 1] range (should approximate the value of pi).

[cos]
Calculate the area under the curve of cos(x) in [-pi/2, pi/2] range.

[normdist]
Calculate the area under the curve of normal distribution in [-inf, inf] range (should give the answer of 1).
