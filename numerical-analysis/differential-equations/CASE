[pendulum]
Solve the ODE of a pendulum with given air resistance numerically: determine the angle at a given time point

[heat]
Solve the PDE of a heat equation numerically: determine the temperature at specific point in space and time

[heat2d]
Solve the PDE of a heat equation in 2D space numerically: determine the temperature at specific point in space and time

> Use whatever method you want (RK4 is a good choice)
> If possible, visualize & animate the results with respect to time change (using multimedia library like SFML or other)
> If possible, use GPGPU library (like OpenCL) to accelerate the computation
